# JSHint
```sh
$ npm -g install jshint
```

# JavaScript that you won't use that much
## Recursion
```js
function whatHappens(){
  console.log("WAT?");
  whatHappens();
}
```

Recursion is dangerous because you can't guarantee that dynamic data won't cause the browser to crash.

## Short Circuit Evaluation
`&&` and `||` use short circuit evaluation, which means that as soon as they figure out the answer, they will stop executing.

```js
true || console.log("short circuited")
```

# jQuery
## Avoid changing appearance with jQuery
- .css `$('.container').css('color', 'red')`
- .animate
- .fadeIn, .fadeOut
- slideUp, slideDown
- .show, .hide

## Event handlers

```js
// ''.cool' is the selector that you're handling events on
// $('.cool') is returning a jQuery object that wraps the '.cool' element(s).
// .on is a method you're calling on the jQuery object
// 'click is the event you're passing as an argument to .on, telling it which event to listen for
// the `function(){}` is an anonymous function that you're passing to the .on method. The function will be called when the event is triggered.
// event is a parameter to receive the event object that is generated by the event. One property of note is event.target.
// this is the element that the event was triggered on (the .cool element in this case).
// $(this) is wrapping the element with jquery so we can call jquery methods on it.
$('.cool').on('click', function(){
  $(this).toggleClass('ice-cold');
})
```

# HTTP
## Meaning
**Hypertext Transfer Protocol**
A set of rules for how computers should communicate.

Current version is HTTP 1.1

## REST
Representational State Transfer

### Meaning
There are resources on a remote computer, and I want to be able to fetch, manipulate, and delete those resources.

RESTful URLs can be accessed as well named resources.

e.g. https://github.com/jacobthemyth/dotfiles means get the `dotfiles` repository from the `jacobthemyth` user.

## URLs, Methods, Statuses
### URL
The parts of the URL should represent different resources, some of which are nested.

### Methods
- GET: fetches the resource
- POST: create the resource
- PUT: update the resource
- DELETE: deletes the resource.
- PATCH: update the resource (not supported in IE8)

Great example: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/

### JSON
Usually we would use the header `Content-Type: application/json`

### Statuses
http://httpstatus.es/
The ones you should be most familiar with:
- 200
- 201
- 400
- 404
- 401
- 500
